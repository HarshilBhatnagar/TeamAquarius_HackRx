2025-07-31 16:01:15,212 - [INFO] - Reasoning: The answer discusses the possibility of claiming the remaining amount from another insurer, which is not explicitly supported by the provided context. The context does not mention the ability to claim from multiple insurers or the specific terms regarding claims for expenses already covered by another insurer. Therefore, while the general idea may be reasonable, it lacks direct support from the context.

2025-07-31 16:02:03,053 - [INFO] - Reasoning: The answer accurately reflects the coverage of abortion as "lawful medical termination of pregnancy" under the policy, while also mentioning the specific exclusions regarding age and the Waiting Period. The conditions for coverage are clearly stated in the context, supporting the answer provided.

2025-07-31 16:02:05,193 - [INFO] - Reasoning: The answer accurately states that Non-infective arthritis is covered under the policy, provided it is not a pre-existing disease. It correctly references the waiting period for coverage, aligning with the context that specifies certain diseases, including Non-infective arthritis, are covered after a waiting period, assuming they are not pre-existing conditions.

2025-07-31 16:02:13,088 - [INFO] - Reasoning: The answer is mostly supported by the context, as it indicates that there is no specific exclusion for Hydrocele mentioned, suggesting potential coverage. It also logically infers that after 6 years, any waiting period for pre-existing conditions may have been satisfied, assuming Hydrocele was not a pre-existing condition. However, the context does not explicitly confirm Hydrocele's coverage, which introduces some uncertainty.
